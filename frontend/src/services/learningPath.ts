Performance Analysis:
- Overall Score: ${metrics.overall_score}
- Weak Areas: ${metrics.weak_areas.join(', ')}
- Strong Areas: ${metrics.strong_areas.join(', ')}

Learning Path Requirements:
1. Focus on improving identified weak areas with targeted interventions
2. Maintain proficiency in strong areas through reinforcement activities
3. Implement progressive difficulty scaling aligned with Cambridge/AQA standards
4. Include specific topic recommendations with learning objectives
5. Provide structured progression milestones
6. Incorporate assessment checkpoints for monitoring progress

Generate a comprehensive learning path that addresses these requirements with specific, actionable recommendations.`;
