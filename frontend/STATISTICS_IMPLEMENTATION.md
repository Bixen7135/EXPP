# Statistics Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive statistics system implemented for tracking solved tasks and sheets with Supabase integration.

## Database Schema

### New Tables Created

1. **task_submissions**
   - Tracks individual task completion attempts
   - Fields: id, user_id, task_id, sheet_id, is_correct, score, time_spent, user_answer, user_solution, difficulty, topic, question_type, submitted_at

2. **sheet_submissions**
   - Tracks sheet completion attempts
   - Fields: id, user_id, sheet_id, total_tasks, correct_tasks, accuracy, total_time_spent, average_time_per_task, submitted_at

3. **user_statistics**
   - Aggregated user statistics
   - Fields: user_id, solved_tasks, total_task_attempts, solved_sheets, total_sheet_attempts, success_rate, average_score, total_time_spent, tasks_by_difficulty, tasks_by_topic, tasks_by_type, recent_activity, last_activity_at

4. **user_progress**
   - Daily progress tracking
   - Fields: id, user_id, date, tasks_completed, sheets_completed, time_spent, accuracy

### Database Functions

- `update_user_statistics()` - Automatically updates user statistics when a task submission is created
- `update_sheet_statistics()` - Updates sheet-related statistics when a sheet submission is created

### Triggers

- `task_submission_statistics_trigger` - Fires after task submission insert
- `sheet_submission_statistics_trigger` - Fires after sheet submission insert

## Services

### userStatistics.ts

New functions:
- `saveTaskSubmission()` - Saves individual task submission
- `saveSheetSubmission()` - Saves sheet submission
- `getUserStatistics()` - Retrieves user statistics
- `getProgressData()` - Gets progress data for a date range
- `getRecentTaskSubmissions()` - Gets recent task submissions
- `getRecentSheetSubmissions()` - Gets recent sheet submissions
- `getStatisticsByTopic()` - Gets statistics grouped by topic
- `getStatisticsByType()` - Gets statistics grouped by question type

## Components Updated

### TaskCompletion.tsx
- Now saves individual task submissions to database
- Tracks sheet ID when completing tasks from a sheet
- Saves sheet submission when completing a sheet

### SheetView.tsx
- Passes sheet ID when navigating to task completion

### Statistics.tsx
- Comprehensive statistics display
- Shows:
  - Success rate and average score
  - Tasks and sheets completed
  - Time spent
  - Tasks by difficulty
  - Progress chart (last 30 days)
  - Recent activity

## Routes

Added `/statistics` route to the router (already linked in Navigation component).

## Usage

1. **Run the SQL schema**: Execute `frontend/src/request.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to create all necessary tables, functions, and triggers.

2. **Task Completion**: When users complete tasks, submissions are automatically saved and statistics are updated.

3. **Sheet Completion**: When users complete sheets, both individual task submissions and sheet submission are saved.

4. **View Statistics**: Navigate to `/statistics` to see comprehensive statistics and progress.

## Features

- ✅ Individual task submission tracking
- ✅ Sheet completion tracking
- ✅ Automatic statistics aggregation
- ✅ Daily progress tracking
- ✅ Statistics by difficulty, topic, and type
- ✅ Progress visualization
- ✅ Recent activity display
- ✅ Time tracking
- ✅ Accuracy calculations

## Next Steps

1. Run the SQL migration in Supabase
2. Test task and sheet completion flows
3. Verify statistics are being tracked correctly
4. Customize statistics display as needed
